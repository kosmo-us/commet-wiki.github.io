No, don\u0026rsquo;t skip this section already. The major intention behind creating COMMET was to get more people (more like\u0026hellip;motivate?) into uploading educational content onto the major torrent sites because, at the time of writing this post (and if there are many such uploaders while you\u0026rsquo;re reading this then I guess we were successful or at least let\u0026rsquo;s assume this community played at least a small part in this), there\u0026rsquo;s barely anyone uploading courses that are meant to be for university students or maybe even high school students, which with itself brings the need for the availability of courses for competitive exams as well (which are as well barely available, especially these courses actually). Here\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of reference how it all started.
So, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we intend to have only uploaders in COMMET. It\u0026rsquo;s no community without variety. Not just for the sake of variety, we welcome seeders, who don\u0026rsquo;t upload (may as well) but help the content reach more people by giving a share of their valuable bandwidth or resources; true heroes (not exaggerated tbh) and an integral part of the system. And people who are interested in accessing the torrents only. Could be students, teachers, or anyone. Or whether you just stumbled upon this wiki randomly out of curiosity. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s warmly welcomed. Even the members who do not wish to upload or seed can help the community as well, by sharing content with those in the community who wish to upload and thus making it recheable to more people. I have explained it in the Contribute page as well. And Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can Join, in case you didn\u0026rsquo;t find the links already. Our ideology #We believe that knowledge and information should flow freely without any constraints, such as economic background or anything of that sort. And those who are buying. Thank you; you are doing a great job as well. Long story short, we are not against anyone, but we are on the side of knowledge-seekers. And knowledge and information should flow freely, as I said.
If you do not support this ideology, I welcome you. If you do, I welcome you. Rules: #Like every organized community, we do have some rules that I hope the members will follow. These apply to everyone, from a general member to the founder.
You are not allowed to share any type of content for the exchange of money or anything equivalent to it. This will get you banned instantly, without any warning. The buyer won\u0026rsquo;t be punished, though.
Doxxing any member of the community will not be tolerated. You are supposed to respect everyone\u0026rsquo;s privacy. Not following this rule will obviously get you banned without a warning.
No NSFW content. You will be warned twice before getting banned.
This wiki page is a collaborative effort, and its content will evolve over time based on the contributions and needs of the community.

Anyone who wishes to upload or who already uploads educational torrents. Anyone, could just be a student who is just interested in accessing such torrents, a seeder who seeks to help the community, someone who wants to interact with other members or uploaders to request content or for any other reason, someone who found a dead torrent from our community and wishes someone else who has it to seed it, or someone who is just curious about such torrents or our COMMET.

Uploaders #The backbone of our community is formed by dedicated uploaders who generously share their educational materials. If you have lecture notes, study guides, textbooks, or any other valuable learning resources, we encourage you to upload and share them with the community. Your contributions directly impact the education of countless individuals.
Verified uploaders are featured on our Uploaders page along with the links to their profiles on torrent sites.
Seeders #Seeders play a crucial role in ensuring the availability and accessibility of shared materials. By seeding, you contribute to the longevity of resources and maintain the availability of content for future learners. This selfless act of supporting the community helps sustain our mission.
Other members #Those who do not want to upload but have access to some valuable learning resources that are not already available or partially available on the torrent sites can share the resources with uploaders for them to upload. More info and the \u0026ldquo;how-to\u0026rdquo; can be found on our discord.
Contribute to the wiki #Every page in this wiki has a link to edit the page, if you think you have found a problem on the page you\u0026rsquo;re reading, go to the link which redirects you to the source file in github repo of this site, make changes and issue a pull request.
You can go even further and add new pages in the wiki if you wish to. Here\u0026rsquo;s the link to the github repo of our site. In case you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to fork a github repo and make changes, we\u0026rsquo;ll soon add a tutorial in Resource Section of our wiki.
Currently we have added nothing in the Resources Section of our wiki, this section is supposed to contain learning resources, tools etc related to torrents, privacy, the internet or anything else that could be useful for uploaders or seeders, or members falling into any category, and the community as a whole. If you consider adding new content to the wiki, our suggestion would be to keep this section your priority. Though any type of contribution is welcomed.
Blogs #We welcome you to share your knowledge and experience with us and write a blog for our wiki. You can add your blog page in our Github or just submit it to us in the discord server. More info about discord submission method is available in the discord itself.

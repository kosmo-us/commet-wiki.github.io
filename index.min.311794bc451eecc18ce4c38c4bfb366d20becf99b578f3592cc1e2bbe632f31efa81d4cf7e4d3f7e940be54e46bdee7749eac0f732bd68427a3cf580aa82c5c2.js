No, don\u0026rsquo;t skip this section already. The major intention behind creating COMMET was to get more people (more like\u0026hellip;motivate?) into uploading educational content onto the major torrent sites because, at the time of writing this post (and if there are many such uploaders while you\u0026rsquo;re reading this then I guess we were successful or at least let\u0026rsquo;s assume this community played at least a small part in this), there\u0026rsquo;s barely anyone uploading courses that are meant to be for university students or maybe even high school students, which with itself brings the need for the availability of courses for competitive exams as well (which are as well barely available, especially these courses actually). Here\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of reference on how it all started. All that said, we are not limited to learning resources related to competitive exams and academic courses only, we want to make every kind of educational resources freely available.
It\u0026rsquo;s no community without diversity. Not just for the sake of variety, we welcome seeders: who don\u0026rsquo;t upload (may as well) but help the content reach more people by giving a share of their valuable bandwidth or resources; true heroes (not exaggerated tbh) and an integral part of the system. And people who are interested in accessing the torrents only. Could be students, teachers, or anyone. Or whether you just stumbled upon this wiki randomly out of curiosity. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s warmly welcomed. Even the members who do not wish to upload or seed can help the community as well, by sharing content with those in the community who wish to upload and thus making it reachable to more people. I have explained it in the Contribute page as well. And here\u0026rsquo;s how you can Join, in case you didn\u0026rsquo;t find the link already. This wiki is a collaborative effort, and its content will evolve over time based on the contributions and needs of the community.

Please note that no one, the founders of the community, the members, neither the mods, nor COMMET itself, is responsible for any copyright infringement that might happen because of any particular torrent. Only the uploader is to be held responsible. COMMET is not a content aggregation platform, neither we store any torrent files on our site. It is solely the responsibility of the uploaders what they choose to upload on the torrent sharing sites of their choice. It\u0026rsquo;s a loosely bound community for sharing freely available educational content in the form of torrents of which any uploader or leecher can be a part of.

How to create a torrent? #We\u0026rsquo;ll again use qBitTorrent for this tutorial, you may use any client of your choice. This tutorial remains relevant irrespective of the personal choice of client Have your files/folder ready. If you want to upload multiple folders then you should organize all of them in a single folder. Click on \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo;, available in the menu bar. Navigate to \u0026ldquo;Torrent Creator\u0026rdquo; from the drop down menu that just opened and click it. Alternatively, you can just use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N to open \u0026ldquo;Torrent Creator\u0026rdquo;. A new window will open, as shown below. Let\u0026rsquo;s learn about each of the options that the window shows us. Path: here you let qBitTorrent know the location of the file/folder you wanna make a torrent of.
Click \u0026ldquo;Select file\u0026rdquo;, only if your torrent has one file, it\u0026rsquo;ll open your file browser, navigate to the file you want to make a torrent of. You\u0026rsquo;ll see that the textbox beside \u0026ldquo;Path\u0026rdquo; has been updated to the location of the file you just selected. To make a torrent of a folder, the process is exactly the same except you click \u0026ldquo;Select Folder\u0026rdquo; and navigate to the folder you want to make a torrent of.
Torrent version, prefer V1 because it is supported by all the clients. If you\u0026rsquo;re sure that the downloader has a client that supports the other versions, only then select the other options.
Piece Size doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter a lot these days as most people have faster internet nowadays, except if there\u0026rsquo;re any piece size limitations by the clients (which I havent seen in modern clients) or if the torrent is huge like 300-500 GB. After googling a bit, it seems like 1200-2200 is the optimum number of pieces as suggested in this article by Torrent Freak. Select the piece size which brings the number of pieces in that range (you can see the number of pieces by selecting \u0026ldquo;Calculate number of pieces\u0026rdquo;)
Don\u0026rsquo;t check \u0026ldquo;Private Torrent\u0026rdquo; unless you\u0026rsquo;re uploading to private trackers.
\u0026ldquo;Start seeding immediately\u0026rdquo; does what it says.
Put your trackers (one tracker per line) in the textbox provided by \u0026ldquo;Tracker URLs:\u0026rdquo;. You can find a list of trackers here.
You can add any comments in the comment section, it does not affect the metadata of the torrent file.
Finally, select \u0026ldquo;Create Torrent\u0026rdquo;. It might take some time, depending on the file/folder size. You\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted with a file explorer to select the path where you want to save the torrent file. Select your preferred path, click OK. That\u0026rsquo;s it! You have successfully created a torrent.
I have downloaded the files of a torrent and I want to share the files of the torrent with my friend but I forgot from where I got the torrent file. What do I do now? #You can find the .torrent file that you downloaded and share it, if you dont have the torrent file then you can share the magnet link. To copy the magnet link of a torrent from your torrent client: right click on the torrent-\u0026gt; select \u0026ldquo;Copy\u0026rdquo;-\u0026gt; Select \u0026ldquo;Copy Magnet Link\u0026rdquo;.
Best torrent clients? #I prefer the open source ones: qBitTorrent, Transmission, Deluge etc. More here
Best VPNs for torrenting and privacy? #Mullvad (one of the best for privacy), Torguard (one of the best for torrenting), PIA, Proton.

Torrent Clients We Recommend #qBitTorrent Rtorrent Deluge Transmission LibreTorrent TRACKERS #Torrent trackers are an integral part of the BitTorrent protocol, a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing system. They serve as servers or central hubs that help coordinate the distribution and sharing of files among users in a decentralized manner. Here\u0026rsquo;s how they work:
Initialization: When a user creates a torrent file, it contains information about the file(s) being shared and the tracker(s) responsible for facilitating the distribution. This information is encoded into the torrent file.
Torrent Client: Users who want to download the file(s) must use a torrent client, like uTorrent, BitTorrent, or qBittorrent. This client reads the torrent file and extracts the tracker information.
Tracker Communication: The torrent client connects to the tracker(s) listed in the torrent file. It sends a request to the tracker to announce itself and request a list of other users who are also downloading or sharing the same file(s). This list is known as the \u0026ldquo;swarm.\u0026rdquo;
Peer Discovery: The tracker responds with a list of peers (other users) who are downloading or sharing the same file(s). The torrent client uses this information to establish direct connections to these peers.
Peer-to-Peer File Sharing: Once connections are established with other peers in the swarm, the actual file data is exchanged directly between users. Each user downloads and uploads pieces of the file to and from other users in the swarm.
Continuous Communication: The torrent client continues to communicate with the tracker periodically to update its status and exchange information about the pieces of the file it has or needs. This helps in efficient and balanced distribution.
Torrent trackers play a crucial role in managing and maintaining the integrity of the torrent ecosystem. They help users discover and connect with peers efficiently, ensuring that file-sharing is decentralized and resilient. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that not all torrents use trackers; some torrents rely solely on Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Peer Exchange (PEX) for peer discovery, making them more decentralized and tracker-independent.
List of working trackers? #You may use google to find tracker lists or you can use some websites that give you ready-made working tracker lists. Here are a few of them (public trackers):
newTrackon ngosang/trackerslist DHT #DHT stands for Distributed Hash Table, and it is a decentralized, distributed system that allows for the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs across a network of participating nodes (computers). DHT is commonly associated with peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and it plays a significant role in enabling decentralized file-sharing and other distributed applications.
Here\u0026rsquo;s how DHT works:
Node Participation: In a DHT network, there are many nodes (computers) that voluntarily participate. Each node is responsible for storing and managing a portion of the DHT\u0026rsquo;s data.
Key-Value Storage: DHT stores data in the form of key-value pairs. Any node in the network can store a key-value pair and later retrieve it by specifying the key.
Distributed Data Storage: The DHT algorithm distributes these key-value pairs across the participating nodes in a way that ensures redundancy and fault tolerance. This means that even if some nodes go offline or leave the network, the data remains accessible through other nodes.
Data Retrieval: To retrieve a specific key-value pair, a node initiates a DHT lookup by querying other nodes in the network. The query is passed from node to node until it reaches the node responsible for storing that particular key. The responsible node then returns the associated value to the querying node.
Decentralization: DHT networks are highly decentralized, meaning there is no central authority or server. This makes them resilient to censorship and failures. Nodes can join or leave the network at will, and the DHT continues to function.
DHT is commonly used in BitTorrent and other P2P file-sharing systems as an alternative or complement to traditional tracker-based peer discovery. With DHT, users can find and connect to peers sharing the same content without relying on a centralized tracker. Instead, they query the DHT to find peers actively sharing the desired file, making the system more robust and resistant to tracker failures or takedowns.
Overall, DHT is a fundamental technology that enables the creation of decentralized and resilient P2P networks and applications. It provides a way for nodes to organize and efficiently access data in a distributed manner without relying on a central server.
PEX #PEX stands for Peer Exchange, and it is a feature commonly associated with peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocols like BitTorrent. PEX is designed to enhance the efficiency of peer discovery and improve the overall performance of P2P networks. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works:
Peer Discovery: In a P2P network, users (peers) need to discover and connect to other peers to exchange data (usually files). Traditional methods for peer discovery include using central trackers or Distributed Hash Table (DHT) systems.
PEX Introduction: PEX is a more decentralized method for peer discovery. When a user joins a P2P swarm (a group of peers sharing the same file), their torrent client can participate in PEX.
Maintaining Peer Lists: With PEX, each participating peer maintains a list of other peers it is connected to within the same swarm. This list is dynamic and constantly updated as new connections are established or existing ones are severed.
Peer Exchange: Periodically, a peer may initiate a PEX exchange with other connected peers in the swarm. During this exchange, the peers share the lists of peers they are connected to within the same swarm.
Updating Peer Lists: After the PEX exchange, each participating peer updates its own peer list based on the information received from others. This process helps ensure that peers have up-to-date information about who is currently part of the swarm.
Efficiency and Redundancy: PEX improves the efficiency of peer discovery by allowing peers to discover new potential connections without relying solely on a central tracker or DHT. It also adds redundancy to the system because peers can learn about each other from multiple sources, reducing the reliance on any single point of failure.
PEX is particularly useful in scenarios where the tracker (if used) is unavailable or unreliable, as it allows peers to find and connect with each other directly. It complements other peer discovery methods like tracker-based peer lists and DHT.
However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that PEX is not without its challenges. While it improves efficiency and redundancy, it also introduces some privacy concerns, as it can potentially reveal a peer\u0026rsquo;s IP address to others in the swarm. Additionally, the effectiveness of PEX depends on the number of peers participating in the exchange, and it may not work well in very small or very large swarms.
Few other common terms related to torrenting: #Torrent: A small file containing metadata about the files you want to download, including their names, sizes, and structure. Torrent files have a \u0026ldquo;.torrent\u0026rdquo; extension.
Seeder: A user who has downloaded a file completely and is currently sharing it with others. Seeders help maintain the availability of the file for download.
Leecher: A user who is in the process of downloading a file but has not yet completed the download. Leechers download from seeders and other leechers.
Peer: A generic term for any user participating in a torrent swarm. This includes both seeders and leechers.
Swarm: The collective group of peers sharing a specific torrent file. A swarm can vary in size and consists of all users downloading or uploading the same content.
Tracker: A server that keeps track of the peers in a torrent swarm. Trackers help facilitate peer discovery and coordination. Public trackers are open to anyone, while private trackers require membership.
DHT (Distributed Hash Table): A decentralized method for peer discovery that doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on a central tracker. DHT allows users to find peers sharing the same file without a dedicated tracker.
Magnet Link: A way to reference a torrent without downloading the \u0026ldquo;.torrent\u0026rdquo; file. Magnet links contain information about the file and how to find peers but do not contain the actual torrent file.
Ratio: The ratio of data uploaded to data downloaded. Maintaining a good ratio is often required on private trackers to avoid being banned.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P): A network architecture where users connect directly to each other to share files, as opposed to downloading from a central server.
Client: A software application that allows you to download and upload torrents. Popular torrent clients include uTorrent, BitTorrent, qBittorrent, and Transmission.
Piece: A small part of the larger file being shared through the torrent. Peers exchange pieces to complete the download.
Super Seeder: A user who only shares the rarest parts of a file to ensure faster distribution in the swarm. Super seeders are common on private trackers.
Torrent Site: A website that hosts torrent files or magnet links for various files. These sites may list torrents for movies, music, software, games, and more
